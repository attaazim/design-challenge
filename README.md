# DocNetwork Design Challenge

In this challenge, you'll be recreating a website of your choice. It's a pretty open-ended challenge, so have fun and showcase your code and creativity.

## What do I do?
- Pick a website
- Recreate it

## No, seriously, what do I do?
Your task is to choose the homepage of a popular website, and recreate a single page site using HTML5 and CSS3. You can recreate one of the sites below, or choose a different website. It's a big internet out there.

Once you've chosen a website to build, fork this repository on GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account already, go make one. Trust me, you'll want one in the long run.

After forking this repository, add your code to recreate your site. Feel free to modify/remove the template files, and separate your site into whatever directory structure you want (just please don't minify your code; we kind of want to review it when you're done).

When finished, edit the `Solution Discussion` section of this README file below. Answer a couple basic questions on your work, and commit your project to Github.

Once you've finished everything and are at least a little proud of your work, submit a pull request to the `docnetwork/design-challenge` repo. We'll take a look at your code and get back to you.


## Things to consider
- **Be Vanilla**  
While we love that you know
Bootstrap/Angular/React/hipstr.js, we're really trying to evaluate your understanding of vanilla web technologies. I know how cool they are, but please avoid using any frameworks.  

- **Don't Cheat**  
Don't scrape a site and pass it as your own code. It's stupid easy to spot, and a surefire way to not get a job.

- **Don't use Dreamweaver/WordPress/WYSIWYGarbage**   Just don't.

- **It doesn't need to be pixel perfect.**  
We don't care if the padding is off. We don't care that you used `#ffffff` instead of `#fefefe`. Just keep your code clean and make it look good.

- **It doesn't need functionality**  
The links don't have to go anywhere. The text can be lorem ipsum if you _really_ want. This is an informal design challenge.

- **It's okay if you get stuck**   
We value good communication skills. If you get stuck and can't finish the challenge, don't be afraid to submit it. You won't automatically be disqualified, just tell us why you couldn't finish, and what the next steps are to overcome the issue.

## Extra Credit
- Use HTML5 semantic tags
- Use CSS3 features where appropriate
- Make your site responsive
- Add JavaScript if you're feeling frisky

#### But I'm a programmer, not a designer!
Well don't whine about it! We're looking for software developers who have varied skillsets and are able to adapt to new technologies. Don't worry, we have plenty of software engineering challenges, on both the Front-End and the Back-End. But if you're a _super-rockstar-ninja-guru_ and already finished this challenge, go check out our [AngularJS challenge](https://github.com/docnetwork/angular-challenge) for something a little more algorithmic.


## Solution Discussion
**Answer these questions before submitting your pull request!**
- Why did you choose the website you did?
 - // This is the default home page for millions of users around the world. I was wondering how well of an imitation I could create.
- What challenges did you face while building your site?
  - // Using CSS without Bootstrap was challenging, yet a good experience.
- What would you do differently next time?
  - // I would make my website more responsive.
